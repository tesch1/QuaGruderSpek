### Overview

Some code to demonstrate the product operator formalism from the
course LV0171 Quantenmechanische Grundlagen der NMR-Spektroskopie
(aka "Quantum Mechanical Principles of NMR Spectroscopy").

Matlab code for using the "Product Operator" formalism, for systems of
1,2, and 3 spins, with some examples of how to calculate with it.
